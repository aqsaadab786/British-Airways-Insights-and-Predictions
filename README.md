# British-Airways-Insights-and-Predictions
This project is part of my Data Science virtual internship program offered by Forage, focusing on British Airways.
## Project Overview
This project is divided into two main tasks:

1. Web Scraping to Gain Company Insights
2. Predicting Customer Buying Behaviour
## Task 1: Web Scraping to Gain Company Insights
Customers who book flights with British Airways (BA) encounter many touchpoints with the BA brand. Understanding their feelings, needs, and feedback is essential for enhancing the overall customer experience.

This task involves scraping and collecting customer feedback and review data from Skytrax, a third-party review platform. The collected data is then analyzed to uncover insights that can help improve the customer experience.

Key Insights Uncovered
Below is a summary of the insights derived from the Skytrax customer review data:


## Task 2: Predicting Customer Buying Behaviour
In today's information-rich environment, the buying cycle has significantly evolved. To remain competitive, airlines must proactively engage potential customers before they begin their travel journey.

This task focuses on building a predictive model to forecast successful bookings using customer bookings data. The model aims to help British Airways anticipate and respond to customer needs more effectively.


##About
This Data Science project aims to analyze customer feedback on service quality and identify areas for improvement to enhance the overall customer experience.
